# Movie Watchlist

With this app users can search for movies by keyword or title, and add titles they'd like to a watchlist. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user searches, the app interfaces with the oMDB API to return up to 10 movies that match the title or keyword entered.
